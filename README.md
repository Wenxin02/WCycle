Data and Codes from the paper "Weighted cycle-based identification of influential node groups in complex networks".

The WCycle_by_Zheng.py is the code for computing Weighted Cycle (WCycle), which is a indicator that incorporates basic cycle structures and edge weights to comprehensively assess node importance.

The network datasets are in Dataset.tar.
